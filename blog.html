    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>Here are some things I wanted to type out. You're not going to want to read them, but you will. 
        I'm going to make sure you look at this and think to yourself, "why is it I am being forced to read this?"
        You'll be stuck reading this blog, forever and ever and ever! Bwahahahahaha!</p>

        <p>If you would've told me I was about to do something drastic at 35 to try and change my life, 
            I would've called you a liar. There was nothing more I loved then feeling safe in the fimilar. 
            But, If I want to get out of the rut and depression I was in, I knew something had to be done...
